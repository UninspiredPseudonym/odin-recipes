                Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

                Arrange haddock fillets on the prepared baking sheet.

                Mix onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; 
                sprinkle seasoning over fish, then dot with butter.

            <li>
                Broil in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes.
